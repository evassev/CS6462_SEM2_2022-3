    "\n",
    "* season: indicates which season it is\n",
    "* rain: indicates whether it is raining\n",

A natural way to represent this structure is a Directed Acyclic Graph. We require the graph to be acyclic to prevent \"causal loops\"."

    "Structural Causal Model is a mathematical description of a Causal Graphical Model where variables are functions of other variables. Here, if we consider the \"sprinkler\" Causal Graphical Model, the variable \"season\" may only influence the variable \"wet\" through \"rain\" or \"sprinkler\", no matter what the actual functions are. This way of modeling structure is appealing because it has a natural way to describe interventions: we reach into the system and replace the value of one variable with one we choose."
